# Rehearsal_Series-Beta_Spaces
an open score for performative measures and embodied maps.


Digital Technologies have been defining new ways of moving, collectively or individually, through  uid nonetheless complex landscapes of data displays, hybrid physical and digital architectures and media environments. Given how fast these changes resonate and reproduce, there is a growing urgency to engage in a critique of technologies that deals with the fact that we are inevitably already entangled.

This workshop questions how standardised, often opaque, hyper-imposed systems influence our understanding and experience of space and of geopolitics.

In <beta-spaces> participants collaboratively develop practices of notation (collection, analysis and creation of scores and scripts) interweaved with somatic practices (movement, sensory perception). Privileging embodied ways of knowing, spatial sensing and the performative â€” we invite participants from various disciplines to explore techniques around mapping, measurement systems, graphical representations that create space for new or other categories that embrace the complexities of the territory that connects people, species, surroundings, objects.
  
The experiments will serve as basis to collectively build prototypes, visualisations and models of speculative body-terrain combinations which will culminate in an open score.
